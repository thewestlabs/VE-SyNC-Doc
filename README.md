### Configuration
**a. Pre-installed Pico W**
  1. All pre-installed Picos come with firmware already baked into it.
  2. Power the VE SyNC module through Micro-USB or 12v/24v JST PH connector. Connect module to your Victron device using VE.Direct cable. 
  3. Configure with bluetooth using this webpage -> [VE SyNC App](https://thewestlabs.github.io/VE-SyNC-Doc/). Read more about using the app on [Wiki](https://github.com/thewestlabs/VE-SyNC-doc/wiki/BLE-App).

**b. Using your own Pico W**

If you opted for your own Pico, check manual configuration steps [wiki/Manual-configuration](https://github.com/thewestlabs/VE-SyNC-doc/wiki/Manual-configuration)

### Data cable

You can use either genuine [VE.Direct](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F9ESFZS) cable (recommended) or build your on DIY cables. ([How?](https://github.com/thewestlabs/VE-SyNC-Doc/wiki/DIY-VE.Direct-cable))

  3. â­• Red blinking - Temporary error
  4. ðŸ”´ Red steady - Fatal error occured

### WiFi Monitoring/ PVOutput/ Home assistant / MQTT
1. You can either monitor through WiFi (local network only) - Type the IP address shown in the BLE app into your browser tab.
2. Or configure cloud uploads using the BLE app. More details can be found at [Wiki/BLE App](https://github.com/thewestlabs/VE-SyNC-Doc/wiki/BLE-App).

### Supported devices
Pretty much any Victron device with a VE.Direct port except BMV-60X.

### FAQ
  1. Will my Victron bluetooth continue to work?  
    Yes, bult-in SmartSolar BLE will continue to work. But BlueSolar external BLE module will not work, because VE.Direct port is occupied. (You can try experimenting with a splitter at your own risk).
  2. Can I upload Inverter/Shunt data to PVOutput?  
    Only charge controller data will be uploaded to PVOutput, other devices will be ignored. But MQTT, HA discovery and custom logging should work with any VE.Direct devices.
  3. Do I need Cerbo GX or Venus OS?  
    It connects directly to your WiFi. No need of Cerbo GX or Venus OS.
